# Traffic-prediction-LSTM-MGCN
This code implements an LSTM-Multi-Graph Convolutional Network (LSTM-MGCN) for short-term traffic flow prediction, combining temporal modeling (2-layer LSTM) with spatial modeling (4-graph GCN including a novel Temporal Lead-Lag Graph) to predict traffic speeds on the SZ-taxi dataset (156 road segments)
